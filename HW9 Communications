Just putting this here for HW communication

Hey so my though is we should swap places from what we did in lab, so for the homework you can add this repository to your computer and do the diffrent model tests
while I go through the code you did and write it out. If not or if your computer can't do it I can, maybe just let me know before noon of 11/2 so I can have time to
do it?

Hi Evan, I've been trying to get open router to work on my windows computer but it's giving me so many error messages. I'm going to keep trying but I wanted to let you know
in case I haven't figured it out in time.













Hey Evan, I tried some more to get it to work this morning but there's some incompatability issues that are preventing aider from installing. 
You can try setting it up on your computer and if it doesn't work for you either we might have to meet in person to figure it out. The due 
date's nov 4 so we still have some time.
