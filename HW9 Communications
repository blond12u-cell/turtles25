Just putting this here for HW communication

Hey so my though is we should swap places from what we did in lab, so for the homework you can add this repository to your computer and do the diffrent model tests
while I go through the code you did and write it out. If not or if your computer can't do it I can, maybe just let me know before noon of 11/2 so I can have time to
do it?
